# üîß Vercel Network Error Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® Issue: "Network error. Please check your connection and try again."

You're seeing this error on the Vercel deployment, which suggests a configuration issue rather than a code problem.

## üîç Most Likely Causes

### 1. **Missing Environment Variables on Vercel**
The app is likely trying to connect to Appwrite but the environment variables aren't configured on Vercel.

### 2. **Appwrite Configuration Issue**
The Appwrite backend might not be properly configured or accessible.

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Solutions

### Step 1: Check Vercel Environment Variables
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your project: `miriani-well-mobile`
3. Go to Settings > Environment Variables
4. Ensure these variables are set:
   - `VITE_APPWRITE_URL`
   - `VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID`
   - `VITE_APPWRITE_STORAGE_ID`
   - `VITE_APPWRITE_USER_COLLECTION_ID`
   - `VITE_APPWRITE_POST_COLLECTION_ID`
   - `VITE_APPWRITE_SAVES_COLLECTION_ID`
   - All wellness-related collection IDs

### Step 2: Quick Test - Enable Mock Mode
If you want to test the UI immediately while fixing the backend:

1. Add this environment variable to Vercel:
   ```
   VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA=true
   ```

2. Redeploy the app

This will enable mock mode with test credentials:
- Email: `test@test.com`
- Password: `password`

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
Open the browser console (F12) and look for:
- üì± Mobile-specific error messages
- üîê Authentication errors
- Network request failures
- Appwrite connection errors

## üîß Debug Information

- **Mode**: Production (not development)

3. **Tap the debug button** to run diagnostics
4. **Try logging in** and watch console for üì± messages

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Check Vercel environment variables** (most likely cause)
